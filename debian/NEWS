rspamd (0.6.10) unstable; urgency=medium

  * In order to be uploaded to Debian, rspamd package has been changed in
    incompatible ways compared to packages from Launchpad PPA or OBS
    previously distributed by rspamd project:

    - /etc/default/rspamd* files are no longer supported. rspamd is run
      under fixed user/group.
    - multiple rspamd instances in single init.d script are no longer
      supported. Use LXC or systemd-nspawn to achieve the same effect.
    - rspamd user/group have been renamed to _rspamd:_rspamd in order to
      decrease chances of name clash with local users.
